This is a collection of modules I find generally useful.

Modules are usually independent; you don't need this whole directory
but it doesn't hurt to grab it all either.

Read more about the modules at these links (docs are still works in process):

cgi.d info: http://arsdnet.net/web.d/cgi.d.html
web.d info: http://arsdnet.net/web.d/web.d.html

Currently included are:

Web related
================

cgi.d  - base module for making webapps in D. Supports cgi, fastcgi, scgi, and embedded_httpd via -version=xxxx
dom.d  - an xml/html DOM based on what Javascript provides in browsers
web.d  - a fancier way to write web apps. Uses reflection to make functions
         accessible via url with minimal boilerplate in your code
email.d - gives read and write support for emails, sending via SMTP and
          reading mbox files

web.d.php - a PHP library meant to ease integration of php components
	    with web.d apps. Gives (read) access to the session, and full
	    access to your D ApiProviders.

html.d - functions to manipulate HTML documents, and now css and javascript
	 with DOM functions, nested css statements, and macros for css and js.

oauth.d - Oauth 1.0 implementation with some helper functions for facebook, twitter, etc.
htmltotext.d - converts html into plain text

rtud.d - a real time update helper for HTML5 EventSource. Kinda buggy.

Database related
================

database.d  - main interface to databases. Includes DataObject
mysql.d     - a mysql engine for database.d (most mature of the three). also includes some basic ORM
postgres.d  - a postgres engne for database.d
sqlite.d    - a sqlite engine for database.d
mssql.d     - a (super crappy) mssql engine for database.d (uses ODBC)
querygenerator.d - a user submission for generating sql queries

Desktop app stuff
================

simpledisplay.d - gives quick and easy access to a window for drawing
htmlwidget.d - a very small html widget, built on simpledisplay.d
terminal.d - quick and easy access to a text mode console/terminal

Game stuff
=================

engine.d, screen.d, audio.d - a quick wrapper to SDL and OpenGL I used
         in the pre D1 days, now updated so it compiles as both D1 and
	 D2 (use the -d switch to dmd)

	 Requires some SDL bindings.

	 Eventually I'll redo it.

Other
================

eventloop.d - first draft of a generic event loop that can be reused by several libraries
              try it with terminal.d or simpledisplay.d with -version=with_eventloop. Only
              works on Linux right now.
sha.d  - implementations of the SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms
image.d - generic image class that can be drawn upon (coming soon) or loaded/written by png.d
png.d  - provides some png read/write support
jpg.d  - just reading jpg header right now
curl.d - a small wrapper around the curl library
csv.d  - gives read support to csv files
http.d - a lighterweight alternative to curl.d
color.d - a basic color struct and some HSL functions
characterencodings.d - conversion to UTF8 of various encodings


Obsolete
================
lazypng.d - now merged into png.d
httpd.d - old http server, use cgi.d with -version=embedded_httpd instead
netman.d - old network helper code, you should try vibe.d <http://vibed.org/> or maybe
           cgi.d's threaded thing instead since this one is now unmaintained and poor in
           quality compared to vibe anyway.
domconvenience.d - now merged into dom.d


Things I'll add when I get the time:

browser.d - a tiny browser based on htmlwidget.d
bmp.d   - gives .bmp read/write
wav.d  - reading and writing WAV files
midi.d - reading and writing MIDI files
simpleaudio.d - gives minimal audio output
minimal.zip - a set of minimal D functions, works on bare metal. see: http://arsdnet.net/dcode/minimal.zip
